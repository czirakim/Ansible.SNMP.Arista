## Ansible.SNMP.Arista

The scope of this project is to automate the process of adding/upgradeing 
<br>the SNMPv3 user.
 

## Usage

The project is made of a main yml file , a vars file and an inventory file.
<br>In the vars file I've defined how we connect to the switches (cli).
<br>Var file contains the credentials for the switches, the SNMPv4 user 
<br>and password(I am using the password for encryption, also) and
<br>the cli connection details.
<br>The main file contains all the tasks.
